#### About myself


At my last job, I was developing extensions for a Qlick Sense analytics system. The work involved visualizing data in the form of various charts such as columns, pie, waterfall and many others. Since the area is quite specialized, I want to expand my skills to a complete front-end developer.

Among my strengths I can note a large amount of free time and a desperate desire to find a job.
